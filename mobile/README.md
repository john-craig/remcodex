# RemCodex mobile app

This Android module is a native shell around the existing RemCodex web client.
It uses the Gitea `chiliahedron/kotlin-template` as its Gradle/Kotlin scaffold
and keeps the server as the source of session, API, and WebSocket behavior.

The debug build defaults to `http://10.0.2.2:3000/` for an Android emulator.
Pass a different server URL with the `com.chiliahedron.remcodex.SERVER_URL`
intent extra, or launch the activity with a URL as its intent data.

From this directory:

```text
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Release automation is tag-driven. Update `version.properties` together with a
tag named `v<versionName>`; `versionCode` must increase for every published
APK. The release variant is intentionally unsigned. Gitea Actions builds it,
rejects signed output, and attaches the APK, SHA-256 checksum, and JSON
manifest to the Gitea Release. Final APK/repository signing is outside this
repository and must remain on the protected F-Droid publishing host.

The workflow expects a pinned runner label such as
`android-34:docker://<approved-android-image>` and the pre-created
`GITEA_RELEASE_TOKEN` Actions secret with permission to create releases and
upload release assets for this repository. It does not create or access
signing keys.
